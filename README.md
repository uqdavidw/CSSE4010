# CSSE4010
VHDL written for Digital System Design (CSSE4010) in Semester 2, 2018 at the University of Queensland. This consisted of:
+ Fortnightly take-home projects
+ Final project

## Take-home Projects
Projects were developed focussing on various digital system concepts.

## Final Project: Lissajous Curve Display Controller
This project generates Lissajous Curves through DAC modules. The curves are controlled by the buttons/switches or entered on the keyboard, and the curves can be made to rotate by tilting the FPGA board (accelerometer). It consists of seven modules:

+ User Control Interface (Buttons, switches)
+ Curve Calculator
+ Hexadecimal Keypad Input
+ Accelerometer
+ Display Storage
+ Display Output
+ Internal Bus Interface
